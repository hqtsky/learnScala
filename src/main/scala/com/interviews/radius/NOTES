Assumptions
  1- Phone numbers' format are already validated to be in the normalized
  format: (xxx)-xxx-xxxx.
  2- Each line in "Users.txt" was assumed to be the following format:
  "id;name;emails;phones", and emails/phones are comma separated lists.
    2.1. Users.txt contains malformed lines (<15users); some cross checks
    show that these users indeed have big transactions amount that might make
    them end up in the top 1000 (a bit unrealistic since usually typos in VIP
    accounts are quickly fixed). Since this is an exercise, these users are
    skipped and logged.

DESIGN DECISIONS & ALTERNATIVES
  1- Solution is pretty straight forward: first eliminate phones in donotcall
  list from users list, eliminate users with no phones, then join with top
  spenders from transactions.txt to get the result.
  2- A minor improvement was made in the last "join": instead of joining the
  full spenders, we only take a small amount of top spenders (1000*5, aka "noTargetUsers * heuristicMultiplier" ) to join with the user info list.
  This will dramatically reduce the amount of join carried out, and we still
  get the 1000 top spenders we need.

COMMANDS
  1- Run: sbt test, and result is stored in "output.txt".


QUESTION
  1- "Selecting the top users based on highest transaction amount for year 2015". From the expected output format, I think "Highest transaction amount" means "highest total transaction amount", instead of "a single highest transaction in a user's all transactions". Please confirm.
  2- "contact users using phone numbers that are not in the donotcall list". Example: top user Tom has 2 numbers: (111)-111-1111 (in donotcall) and (222)-222-2222 (NOT in donocall). Tom should still show up in the top-1000 list. Please confirm.
  3- If a user ends up in the top-1000 but doesn't have an "eligible" phone number, we will instead select the next best user with at least an eligible in the top user list.

Feedback:
  1- An example would be helpful.
